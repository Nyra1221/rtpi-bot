This app requests only basic profile info, the same as any other Facebook app.
No personal information is viewed or stored, although for testing and 
debugging purposes, some messages sent to the bot are logged (for detecting
bad stops/errors) and to improve the app.

This app is not affiliated with Dublin Bus.
