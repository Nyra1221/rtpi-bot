# Dublin Bus RTPI Bot for Facebook Messenger.
This is an app run via a Heroku server which takes user input from a bus stop number in a Facebook message, polls the Dublin Bus RTPI server and returns a neatly
formatted list to the user. It uses code written by Hartley Brody, without which this would have taken a lot longer to make, so many thanks!
